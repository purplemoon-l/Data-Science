    "1\\. After a few beers your CIO invited his buddy from Green Berry consulting to propose a project using data mining to improve the targeting of the new service that you have been a principal in developing. The service has been quite successful so far, being marketed over the last 6 months via your ingenious, and very inexpensive, word-of-mouth campaign. You've already garnered a pretty large customer base without any targeting, and you've been seeing this success as your best stepping stone to bigger and better things in the firm. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some reflection, you've decided that your best course of action is to play a key role in ensuring the success of this data mining project as well. You agree with your CIO's statement in a meeting with Green Berry, that accurate targeting might cost-effectively expand your audience substantially to consumers that word-of-mouth would not reach. You accept that what Green Berry says about the characteristics of your service is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what we have covered in class, identify the four most serious weaknesses/flaws in this abridged version of Green Berry's proposal, and suggest how to ameliorate them.  Your answer should be 4 bullet points, each comprising 2-4 sentences: 1-2 sentences stating each weakness, and 1-2 sentences suggesting a better alternative.  Maximal credit will be given when the 4 points are as independent as possible.\n",
